# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis..

## Libraries used
- Keras
- Tensforflow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 

## Layers used
- 3 Convolutions layers
- 1 rescalling layer
- 3 Dropout layesrs
- 2 Dense layers

## Activation functions
- Relu
- Softmax with dense layer

## Conclusions
- Yes the overfitting issue is slove by using the class reblancing as shown in the above graph the traning accuracy is app to 88% where as the testing accuracy is to 86%.

accuracy: 0.8795
loss: 0.3164
val_accuracy: 0.8604
val_loss: 0.5448
